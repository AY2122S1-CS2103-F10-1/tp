### Project: MrTechRecruiter

MrTechRecruiter (MTR) is a standalone desktop app aimed in helping technology-related company recruiters overlook and administer job positions and applicants applying for various jobs in their companies.
With the advent of technology and related jobs, MTR uses Command-Line Interface (CLI) for quicker and easier typing for regular users while maintaining a exemplary Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is built upon the fundamentals provided by [AddressBook Level-3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/), a desktop address book application used to teach Software Engineering principles to students.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added calculation of rejection rates for positions.
    * What it does: `rate` - Allows the user to calculate the rejection rate of a job position existing in MrTechRecruiter.
    * Justification: This feature forms part of the base product for company recruiters to have a sensing of how competitive a job position might be.
    * Highlights: Although the calculation is somewhat trivial, how to implement it was a little more tricky since we did not want to freely access private methods. Debugging is also harder as the initial implementations
    of updating the application status did not actually update the model itself which made the calculations fail.

   * Changed the `UI` by placing `applicantBook` beside `positionBook`.
